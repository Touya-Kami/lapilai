    Information on weekly missions, as well as translations for helping you
    achieve them.
---

Weekly missions reset each Monday at 4am JST and give some rewards 10 badges.
You are presented with additional rewards for every 15 badges you collect, up to
75 badges (5 reward sets). The first two rewards are gems; the third and fourth
rewards are scrollbooks; and the fifth reward is an SP summon ticket!

Not all missions below will be available to you every week; you will be assigned
8 missions, drawn from the pool of guarenteed missions (all), as well as
additional missions from the pool of extra missions. `requires
confirmation`{:.warning}

Since you are given more than 5 missions, you don't have to clear every mission
to reach 75 badges.

Credits go to Cremonese#0039 from the Discord server for helping translate these
missions!
