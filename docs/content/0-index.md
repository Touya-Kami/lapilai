This section hosts a variety of translated content that might be useful as
references during your journey. Currently we have most daily and weekly
missions transated, and in the future plan to translate other missions (such as
guild and event missions), as well as consolidate various bonus mechanics
such as unit bond skills in one place.

New players might particularly want to refer to the [starter Tiara
event](content/release-tiara) missions, as these missions guide one through most
mechanics of the game, give a bunch of useful rewards, and cap it off with a
free UR Tiara card!
