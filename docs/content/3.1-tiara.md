title: Starter Tiara event
permalink: /content/release-tiara
---

To celebrate the release of the game (and you playing it), you can obtain a UR
Tiara by progressing through the story and completing some side goals!

The event lasts for 60 days from the creation of your account, giving you time
to progress at your own pace.

The event is separated into five categories that unlock after completing enough
missions from the previous category, intended to walk you through the start of
the story and exploring what the game has to offer.

Every 20 missions (or more specifically, medals that are awarded from each
mission), you will be rewarded with blue gacha tickets which can be redeemed in
sets of ten for a guarenteed SSR or rarer card!

All of the mechanics these quests require are (or will be) explained in the
[guide](../guide/faq), so if you're stuck on any of them, head over there and
have a look! If you feel lost in-game, tapping the blue button on any mission
will take you to where you need to be to complete it.

All quests also reward one medal, which is not included for brevity.

[^1]: If you're new to Japanese games, note that Japanese numbers count in
    groups of 10,000 rather than 1,000 like English does, so 10,000 is
    represented as 1万 (one ten-thousand).

## Blossom

The Tiara reward requires 100 medals, but there are actually 101 missions! This
means you can avoid completing one mission and still gain the final reward; this
will probably be the Trinity mission.
