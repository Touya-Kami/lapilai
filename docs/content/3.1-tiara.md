title: Starter Tiara event
permalink: /content/release-tiara
---

To celebrate the release of the game (and you playing it), you can obtain a UR
Tiara by progressing through the story and completing some side goals!

The event lasts for 60 days from the creation of your account, giving you time
to progress at your own pace.

The event is separated into five categories that unlock after completing enough
missions from the previous category, intended to walk you through the start of
the story and exploring what the game has to offer.

Every 20 missions, you will be rewarded with blue gacha tickets which can be
redeemed in sets of ten for a guarenteed SSR or rarer card!

All of the mechanics these quests require are (or will be) explained in the
[guide](../guide/faq), so if you're stuck on any of them, head over there and
have a look!
