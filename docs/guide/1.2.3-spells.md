Spell Music, or simply spells, is an additional type of attack that uses MP to
make. The MP cost of a spell is shown on the card â€“ not all spells cost the same
amount of MP to cast.

You can activate as many spells in one turn as you want or can, as long as you
have the MP for it. Knocked-out or status-impaired characters cannot use their
associated spells. Unused spells are retained for the following turn, and gain
one charge. If you use a spell, you will get a new spell available to you next
turn to replace it.

After casting one or more spells, you can still make your regular attack as
above.

Spell Music can be charged by making yellow session attacks, up to a maximum of
5 charges. The charge level of a spell is shown as a yellow bar on the card.
Charging a spell increases the power of its effects (e.g., dealing more damage
or restoring more health). `needs confirmation`{:.warning}
