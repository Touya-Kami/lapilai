## Frequently asked questions

This guide doesn't answer all questions, but to save people time in asking and
answering them, some extra questions are posed here.

### Can I play Lapis Re:LiGHTs on an emulator / BlueStacks / Nox / PC?

No, the game will not launch on emulators at the current time. KLab has made no
indication if they plan to support emulators in the future. Google is reportedly
working on a method to play Android titles natively on Windows PCs, but
compatibility for this method remains unknown.

### Sharing to Twitter / LINE gives me an error message?

On launch, the sharing functionality was reportedly broken for a lot of users.
KLab should fix this in time.

### I've unlocked the arena, but I can't access it?

The arena is probably down for maintenance while KLab addresses issues with it.
We don't know when it'll be back up.
