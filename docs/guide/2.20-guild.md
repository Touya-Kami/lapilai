The guild hall is unlocked by clearing the main story quest 4-4. Guilds offer
some new questing content, including lots of rewards, and a place to
collaboratively work towards clearing a dungeon every fortnight.

## Mirror

{% include image.html file="guild-mirror.png" description="Initial layout of the illusionary realm." %}

The illusion realm, or mirrors, is the main content in guilds. It gives a
dungeon-style progression that resets on a fortnightly basis (every two weeks).

There are some major changes to combat and stats while in the mirror world:

1. No supporting members can be included in teams.
2. Damage sustained during battle is held between battles. *If a witch dies,
   they will not be revived at the end of combat*. Health can be restored
   between battles through a limited supply of elixirs.
3. Players can collect special bonuses from certain rooms that provide
   power-ups.

### Progression

Mirrors are progressed by exploring the illusionary world it contains, and
defeating enemies.  After a certain amount of progression, a mirror is completed
— it cannot be entered any further, and rewards are given to all participating
guild members.

Functionally, mirrors are progressed by moving through the world and choosing
from one of three doors at each stage of movement. Doors can be one of four
types, and contain different contents. A mirror is only progressed (as a whole)
by clearing battle doors, but individual reward progression can come from
selecting any door. Mirrors are generally more difficult from left to right,
with the last mirror beign particularly hard.

{% include image.html file="guild-prog.png" description="Basic layout of mirror progression, showing from left to right: a green door, a red door, and a purple door." %}

- Green doors lead to healing rooms, which restore the health of all members in your *current* party.
- Red doors lead to battle rooms, containing enemies to fight.
- Purple doors lead to bonus rooms, providing a selection of a [bonus ability](#bonuses) to gain for the duration of the mirror.
- Gold doors lead to treasure rooms, providing a selection of immediate rewards.

The mirror is progressed by clearing red battle rooms. Battles award increased
progression with each room cleared in a single mirror each day, with up to 4
points rewarded for the 5th battle room. Monsters in each room will be
progressively harder as well, so be careful about how much risk you take on!

After clearing all five mirrors, the boss battle becomes available. It is a very tough enemy and will require the entire guild to work together to bring it (and its hard version) to bring it down. Unlike regular battle rooms, you will receive rewards just for attempting the boss battle, and all participating members will gain a large reward after it is defeated.

### Rewards

Rewards are given for winning a battle, participating in a boss battle (win or
lose), and for clearing an entire single mirror or boss battle.

Treasure rooms, from gold doors, can give one of the following rewards:

- 1,000 flora;
- 15 gems; or
- 1 random unlimited UR shard.

### Bonuses

Special bonuses are powerful assets that are acquired from purple doors.

Bonuses last for the entire duration of the illusion realm, which is reset each
fortnight.

Bonuses stack with each other, but bonuses of the same name cannot be taken more
than once (e.g., you cannot stack Holy Shield).

## Skills

Guild skills provide passive bonuses for all guild members. They can be unlocked
and upgraded using guild skill badges, which are obtained from clearing mirrors
and bosses. **Guild skills apply in all battles, not just those inside the
illusionary realm**, so make sure you and your guild work to increase them!
