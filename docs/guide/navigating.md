1. Goods
2. Dessert
3. Toys

## Affection

As you progress through the game, you can grow closer to the witches in your
class and learn more about them, and maybe even...?!

Affection increases by giving gifts, interacting, listening to their stories or
messages or calls, and similar interactions.

Every 5 affection ranks, you will gain some rewards and potentially unlock new
major features or systems.

While not listed in the table for consistency, there are additional voice line
unlocks at every level ending in 0, 5, and 8 (5, 8, 10, etc.).
