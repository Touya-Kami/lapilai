Star ranking is the secondary method of improving your cards, and unlocks stat
improvements and new skills.

Increasing star ranking consumes *Secrets of Stars scrolls*, or more simply
*scrolls*, which can be acquired through witch activities, hard quests (on first
completion), and examination resource quests.

A cardâ€™s star ranking affects their level cap (in combination with your player
ranking), unlocks new skills, and increases stats.

For SSR and UR cards, star rank 1 is incredibly important as it unlocks their
[enhanced attack]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/1.2.2-attacks.md %}), which is
vital for their use.
