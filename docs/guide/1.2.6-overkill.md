    What happens after killing an enemy and you still have attacks left.
---

The game will automatically target enemies for you, but you can also choose an
enemy to focus at the start of a turn. All attacks in a turn will focus the
targeted enemy until it dies.

When an enemy dies, remaining hits from a single attack (e.g., dying to the
first hit in a two-hit attack) will continue to hit the dead enemy. Successive
attacks will switch to a new target, if one is available. If there are no other
targets, any remaining attacks in the session will fire on the dead target.
`targeting priorities need confirmation`{:.warning}

Attacks made on a "dead" enemy have a chance to drop extra loot contained in
chests. There are three rarities of chests. Causing more overkill damage
increases the chance to drop chests, but will not improve the chances for a rare
chest. `requires confirmation`{:.warning}

Common (brown) chests have no limit to the number of times they can drop, but
blue and red chests can only drop up to 20 times per day.

Blue and red chests can drop gems! The drop rate for gems from these chests
appears to be around 10%, and can contain up to 15 gems per drop.
