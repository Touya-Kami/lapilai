Flower ranking is equivalent to evolving cards in other games, and unlocks
improvements for the skills of cards.

Increasing flower ranking consumes *star stones*, specific to card to be
improved. Star stones are acquired from duplicate cards in gacha (30 shards
each), through card quests, and through hard story quest lines.

Instead of using specific star stones improve flower ranking, UR cards can
utilise *heavenly star stones* as substitute star stones. Heavenly star stones
are not locked to a specific card, which makes them very versatile in a pinch.
However, they are difficult or expensive to obtain.

The cost of improving flower ranking goes up with each rank, as below.

| Rank X | Cost                                               |
|:------:|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | 10                                                 |
| 2      | 30 (total 40)                                      |
| 3      | 50 (total 90)                                      |
| 4      | 70 (total 160)                                     |
| 5      | 90 (total 250) `requires confirmation`{:.warning}  |
| 6      | 110 (total 360) `requires confirmation`{:.warning} |

Higher rarity cards have additional flower ranking stages: while a R card has
only 3 ranks, a UR card has 6 ranks!

Some cards may give cosmetic headpieces, such as earrings or headbands, for
reaching flower rank 2. The simplest example of this is with the initial SR
cards.
