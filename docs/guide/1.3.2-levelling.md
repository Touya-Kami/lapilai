Levelling cards is the primary way of making them stronger, improving their
defensive and offensive ability, and helping you clear more difficult quests.
While cards naturally gain experience through questing, it's much faster to
directly feed them experience through items.

In-universe, various pyroxene minerals are the essence of magic and power most
of the magical world. The same pyroxenes, along with its powdered forms, are
used level up your cards. There are three tiers of levelling items that you will
find in your journey:

The maximum level of a card is influenced by your player level and by the card's
[star ranking]({% link guide/1.3.3-stars.md %}). An individual card's maximum
level is determined by `20 ✕ (star rank + 1)` (i.e., 20 for star rank 0, 40 for
star rank 1, ...).  Your player level determines the maximum level for *all*
your cards, and is determined by `5 ✕ ((player level ÷ 5) + 1)` (i.e., 5 at
player level 1, 10 at player level 5, 15 at player level 10, ...). A card's
effective level cap is the lower of both of these numbers; for example, a card
at star rank 2 and player level 40 can only reach level 45, but a star rank 1
card can reach its (relative) full potential of level 40.
