## Affection

As you progress through the game, you can grow closer to the witches in your
class and learn more about them, and maybe even...?!

Affection increases by giving gifts, interacting, listening to their stories or
messages or calls, and similar interactions.

Every 5 affection ranks, you will gain some rewards and potentially unlock new
major features or systems.

While not listed in the table for consistency, there are additional voice line
unlocks at every level ending in 0, 5, and 8 (5, 8, 10, etc.).

## Equipment enhancement

Equipment is improved by imbuing them with magic from *spellbooks* obtained through unit quests. All equipment can be imbued, but only one imbuement can be active at once. Just like cards, spellbooks come in multiple rarities, from R to `requires confirmation`{:.warning}. Higher-rarity spellbooks confer stronger individual effects.

Spellbooks come in multiple flavours and grant different effects based on their type:

- LiGHTs quests: *guard* and *repair* spellbooks
- IV Klore quests: `requires confirmation`{:.warning}
- Konohana quests: *heal* and *shield* spellbooks
- Sugar Pockets quests: `requires confirmation`{:.warning}
- Sadistic Candy quests: `requires confirmation`{:.warning}
- supernova quests: `requires confirmation`{:.warning}

Having multiple pieces of equipment with the same imbuement will grant bonus effects to the character equipping them.

| Spellbook | 3-piece bonus                        | 6-piece bonus                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| *guard*   | `requires confirmation`{:.warning}   | `requires confirmation`{:.warning} |
| *repair*  | `requires confirmation`{:.warning}   | `requires confirmation`{:.warning} |
| *heal*    | 15% bonus HP                         | `requires translation`{:.warning}  |
| *shield*  | 7% bonus critical chance             | 25% bonus critical damage          |
| *flash*   | 5% bonus physical and magical attack | 10% bonus offensive damage         |
| *smash*   | 7% bonus defences                    | `requires translation`{:.warning}  |

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance2.png" description="Selecting a spellbook to apply" %}

In the enhancement screen, you can see your available spellbooks on the left, the currently-selected equipment, and any spellbook effects applied to it. Applying a spellbook can be confirmed by tapping the red button. Applying a spellbook will consume it.

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance3.png" description="Applying a heal spellbook and receiving two SS-rated bonuses" %}

Applying a spellbook will confer ranom stat bonuses onto the equipment based on the type of spellbook, with rarer spellbooks granting larger bonuses. You can see which end of the possible range of values an individual bonus is, along with a rating from C to SS.

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance5.png" description="Cancelling an enhancement" %}

You can choose to apply the enhancement by tapping the blue button, or cancel applying the enhancement by closing the window in the top-right. You will be asked to confirm this action; the red button will return you to the window, and the blue button will close the window and return you to the top screen.

Spellbooks are consumed regardless of whether you accept an enhancement or not. You can't just keep rolling the same spellbook forever!

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance4.png" description="Replacing an existing enhancement" %}

You might not be happy with the bonuses you received, because they were too weak or of the wrong type. Replacing an enhancement is the same process as initially applying one. You can see a comparison of your enhancement bonuses before choosing to accept the enhancement, so you don't have to remember what you had previously.
