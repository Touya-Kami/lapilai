Unit quests are side-stories to the main quests focusing on a single unit, such
as LiGHTs or IV Klore, as well as the primary method of obtaining
[spellbooks](../witches#equipment-enhancement). They are unlocked as you
progress through the main story, and usually after arcs focusing on that unit.
The table below provides the unlocking points for each unit story.

| Unit               | Main quest                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| LiGHTs             | 6-11 `requires confirmation`{:.warning} |
| Kono Hana wa Otome | `requires confirmation`{:.warning}      |
| IV Klore           | `requires confirmation`{:.warning}      |
| Sugar Pockets      | 10-10                                   |
| Sadistic Candy     | 12-6                                    |
| supernova          | 14-6                                    |

Each quest alternates between a story node talking with the characters, and a
battle node rewarding spellbooks.

At release, each unit story has two parts to it, both 14 nodes long (8 story and
6 battles, including one boss live).
