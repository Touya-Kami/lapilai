Unit quests are side-stories to the main quests focusing on a single unit, such
as LiGHTs or IV Klore, as well as the primary method of obtaining
[spellbooks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/1.3.6-equipment.md %}). They are
unlocked as you progress through the main story, and usually after arcs focusing
on that unit. The table below provides the unlocking points for each unit
story.

| Unit               | Main quest                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| LiGHTs             | 7-11                               |
| Kono Hana wa Otome | 7-11                               |
| IV Klore           | `requires confirmation`{:.warning} |
| Sugar Pockets      | 10-10                              |
| Sadistic Candy     | 12-6                               |
| supernova          | 14-6                               |

Each quest alternates between a story node talking with the characters, and a
battle node rewarding spellbooks.

At release, each unit story has two parts to it, both 14 nodes long (8 story and
6 battles, including one boss live). Unit quests are limited to playing times
*per quest*, meaning a maximum of 30 unit quests per day.
