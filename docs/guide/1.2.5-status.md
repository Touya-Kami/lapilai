Status conditions are divided into damaging and impairing status conditions.
Multiple damaging status conditions can be applied at once (e.g., poison and
burn), but only one impairing status condition can be active at a time (i.e,.
cannot be both asleep and frozen). Triggering a new impairing status condition
while one is already active will replace the old one.

Damaging status conditions can be stacked up to 7 times each, dealing more
damage based on the number of stacks. Boss monsters are
more resistant to damaging status conditions than regular monsters.

Impairing status conditions must be applied 3 times before the status condition
will activate.

Conditions last for two turns (before your third turn after applying the effect)
before wearing off.  Applying another stack of a condition resets the decay
timer, but the timer cannot be reset after hitting the maximum number of stacks.
