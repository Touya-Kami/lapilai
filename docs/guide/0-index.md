Welcome to the guide! This site will aim to not only introduce the basics of
playing Lapis Re:LiGHTs, but provide as much translated content and in-depth
knowledge as we have available.

You can navigate to different sections in the guide with the sidebar on the
left, or following the previous/next navigation links at the bottom of the page.

## Reading this guide

Pages are laid out in sections and attempt to maintain some flow between
sections where possible. If a particlar UI page or mechanic is simple to
explain, then it will be explained where it first appears; otherwise, there will
be a brief overview, and a link to the relevant section in another part of the
guide *containing advanced or specific details*, looking [like
this](#reading-this-guide). For the most part, we hope that you can read the
guide front-to-back without feeling lost.

Some sections will be annotated with info boxes like this. They point out
information that might be easy to miss, gotchas, or tips for a section.
{:.info}

Important advice that might cost resources or time to ignore will be coloured
red instead, to help them stand out.
{:.error}

Similarly, some sections will have warning boxes like this, meaning that a
section or page has content issues to be aware of.
{:.warning}

Finally, some sections may have inline warnings `such as this`{:.warning},
pointing out individual parts of the documentation that might be missing or
under-standard.

## Frequently asked questions

This guide doesn't answer all questions, but to save people time in asking and
answering them, some extra questions are posed here.

### Can I play Lapis Re:LiGHTs on an emulator / BlueStacks / Nox / PC?

No, the game will not launch on emulators at the current time. KLab has made no
indication if they plan to support emulators in the future. Google is reportedly
working on a method to play Android titles natively on Windows PCs, but
compatibility for this method remains unknown.

### Sharing to Twitter / LINE gives me an error message?

On launch, the sharing functionality was reportedly broken for a lot of users.
KLab should fix this in time.

### How do I choose my favourite girl to appear on the home screen?

The home screen is customisable through the [room menu](navigating#rooms).

### How do I unlock the songs needed for the Tiara mission / Kinki no MÃ¤rchen / Trinity?

Read the relevant section in the [starter Tiara event
guide](../content/release-tiara).
