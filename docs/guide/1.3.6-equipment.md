Equipment is improved by imbuing them with magic from *spellbooks* obtained
through unit quests. All equipment can be imbued, but only one imbuement can be
active at once. Just like cards, spellbooks come in multiple rarities, from R to
SSR. Higher-rarity spellbooks confer stronger individual effects.

Spellbooks come in multiple flavours and grant different effects based on their
type.  Having multiple pieces of equipment with the same imbuement will grant
bonus effects to the character equipping them.

As of 2022 (build App1.1.0, Res202112291718-7-685bf350b6), some set bonuses appear to be
implemented incorrectly or misleadingly (mismatched effect and tooltip) or not at
all. These bonuses are marked with a warning symbol <span class="fas
fa-exclamation-triangle"></span> or error symbol <span class="fas
fa-times"></span> respectively.

Since the 6-piece bonuses require having six pieces of equipment, they
effectively require affection level 20 to unlock for a character.
{:.info}

[^1]: 3-piece *guard* set appears to give 10% bonus defences.
[^2]: This refers to healing abilities *made by* the character, not healing *targeting* the character.
[^3]: 6-piece *yell* set appears to be mutually exclusive with other set bonuses when granted to allies, such as *magna* (i.e., will override instead of stack).
[^4]: 6-piece *spirit* set restores 15% of damage taken rather than restoring based on the character's HP.
[^5]: 6-piece *repair* set restores 10% HP.
[^6]: 6-piece *shield* set restores shield equal to 30% of the character's shield that procs the effect (2.2 &times; the card's defence), not 30% of the total shield.

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance2.png" description="Selecting a spellbook to apply" %}

In the enhancement screen, you can see your available spellbooks on the left,
the currently-selected equipment, and any spellbook effects applied to it.
Applying a spellbook can be confirmed by tapping the red button. Applying a
spellbook will consume it.

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance3.png" description="Applying a heal spellbook and receiving two SS-rated bonuses" %}

Applying a spellbook will confer ranom stat bonuses onto the equipment based on
the type of spellbook, with rarer spellbooks granting larger bonuses. You can
see which end of the possible range of values an individual bonus is, along with
a rating from C to SS.

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance5.png" description="Cancelling an enhancement" %}

You can choose to apply the enhancement by tapping the blue button, or cancel
applying the enhancement by closing the window in the top-right. You will be
asked to confirm this action; the red button will return you to the window, and
the blue button will close the window and return you to the top screen.

Spellbooks are consumed regardless of whether you accept an enhancement or not. You can't just keep rolling the same spellbook forever!
{:.error}

{% include image.html file="howto-enhance4.png" description="Replacing an existing enhancement" %}

You might not be happy with the bonuses you received, because they were too weak
or of the wrong type. Replacing an enhancement is the same process as initially
applying one. You can see a comparison of your enhancement bonuses before
choosing to accept the enhancement, so you don't have to remember what you had
previously.
