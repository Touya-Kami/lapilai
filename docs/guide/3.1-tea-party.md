Short version:

1. Play event missions to collect keys.
2. Use keys to clear missions and get candy.
3. Use candy to roll lottery balls.
4. Repeat as much as you want.

In each lottery box there are shards for the UR event Salsa (15 in box 1, 15 in
box 2, and 20 in box 3). You will need to obtain the shards from the first three
boxes to summon Salsa. The 4th box is repeatable as much as you want, but there
is only a single shard in each box.

Event quests cost varying stamina, but are generally more efficient for stamina
spent to keys gained as they get harder.  Bosses cost no stamina but cost
increasing keys in difficulty. Harder difficulties are always more efficient for
keys spent to candy gained that easier ones, so advice is to push as hard as
you're willing and dump all your keys on the last boss you've cleared.

After moving onto a new box, you cannot return to previous boxes. When you win
the shards out of a given box, you will be prompted to ask if you want to move
to the next box. Hitting OK (red) will permanently move you to the next box, and
hitting cancel (blue) will keep you on the current box to clean it out.
